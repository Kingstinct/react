This is a utility library for React that we use across our projects at Kingstinct (still early days for this lib).

To import a utility the best is to import it directly:
`import useEvent from '@kingstinct/react/hooks/useEvent'`

You can also use named imports, but if you're not having all dependencies installed you'll probably run into errors:
`import { useEvent } from '@kingstinct/react'`
